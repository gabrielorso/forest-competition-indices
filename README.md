# Forest Competition Indices
 
 Just some earlier attemps to calculate competition indices between trees during my master's in 2018. I've included some fake data based on a sample from the original data. 
 
 The main competition indices calculated were Hegyi, Glover & Hool, BAL, Martin & Ek, the size-difference approach of Tom√© & Burkhart (1989), and an Area Potentially Available based on Voronoi polygons. I have also tested the effect of distance from the target tree, in a very inefficient and time-consuming way though.
